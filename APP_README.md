🌤️ Animated Weather App

This is a modern, interactive weather app focused on clean design, smooth animations, and an immersive user experience.

The app shows current weather conditions along with key stats like temperature, humidity, feels-like, wind, and more. Each stat is clickable and expands into a detailed view with extra explanations, animated visuals, and smooth transitions, making the weather easy and enjoyable to explore.

The forecast goes beyond a basic 5-day view. You can tap into each day for deeper breakdowns (morning, afternoon, night), see trends for the days after the week, and understand how the weather is expected to change over time.

The UI uses a glossy, glass-like style with soft gradients and subtle background art that adapts based on the selected weather condition or stat. Animations are calm and fluid, keeping the interface clear while still feeling alive.
